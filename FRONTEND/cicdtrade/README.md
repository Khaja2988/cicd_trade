# Virtual Stock Trading App (React + Vite)

This project is a starter for a Virtual Stock Trading App built with React and Vite. It provides a minimal setup with HMR and ESLint.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Roadmap ideas

- Portfolio dashboard with holdings, PnL, and charts
- Paper trading with market/limit orders and order history
- Watchlists with real-time quotes (mock or API)
- Learning mode with tips and explanations

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
